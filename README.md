# g00s3_life
A spinoff of Duck Life's flying game mode created by Meredith Alley, Aaron Codrington, and Gabe Zak



# Goal of project:
The goal of this project was for us to relive the best days of middleschool playing Duck Life during class. 
We all love the original Duck Life game and decided we would like to replicate the flying game mode using python.
This project served as a great way to improve our coding prowess and satiated our nostalgia.
